title: "Solving The Flowshop Problem Using Iterative Beam Search"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/flowshop-ibs
excerpt: "This work presents a modified Iterated Beam Search (IBS) algorithm for solving the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP). Our method combines bi-directional schedule building, guided branching, a second-chance mechanism, and local hill climbing to enhance solution quality. Parameter analysis shows how beam width and perturbation strategies affect performance. Experiments on Taillard instances confirm the approach's effectiveness in balancing exploration and computational cost."
